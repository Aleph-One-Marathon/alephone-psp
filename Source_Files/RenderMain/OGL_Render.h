	OpenGL Interface File,
	by Loren Petrich,
	March 12, 2000

	This contains functions intended to interface OpenGL 3D-rendering code
	with the rest of the Marathon source code. It was separated from the
	presence-accessing and parameter-accessing code in OGL_Control because
	this include file contains some stuff used by the rendering code.

July 8, 2000:
	Modified OGL_SetView() and OGL_Copy2D() to control whether or not to use a back buffer,
	and whether or not to write to the back buffer, respectively.
