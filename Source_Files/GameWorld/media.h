Feb 3, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Added Jjaro media type

May 17, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Added XML-parser support

June 3, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Made accessors return the null pointer for invalid index values;
	also added is-media-dangerous function for use in determining whether a monster
	should step into it.

July 1, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Inlined the media accessors; added map.h here to define SLOT_IS_USED

Aug 29, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Added packing and unpacking routines
