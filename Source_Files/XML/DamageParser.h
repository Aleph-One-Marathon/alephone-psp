	This parses damage elements (name "damage").
	and returns the result into a damage_definition structure.
	
	These are:
	type (NONE, all damage types),
	flags (0 or 1 [is alien: weaker in easier difficulty levels])
	base
	random
	scale (1 = identity scaling)
	These are read in as values of attributes with these names;
	all of them are optional.
