// ZZZ: observe: in a ring topology especially, everyone must treat the ring token as a 'hot potato' - i.e.
// deal with it and pass it on ASAP - to avoid introducing ring latency (which of course impacts all hosts).
// This is why we use separately scheduled elements (like the original) and don't depend on occasional polling
// from the main thread (e.g. between frames).
// In a star (client-server) topology, this should be less of an issue, since overall latency would be related
// to the slowest station's latency, rather than the sum of everyone's latency.
// We want these scheduling elements to have higher priority than the main thread to make sure they are
// scheduled as close as possible to the time they ought to be scheduled.  SDL_Thread provides no mechanism
// to alter thread priority currently.  I guess we'll either have to extend it somehow, or else pray that

// Of course, it won't bother getting or storing real action_flags, since the packet handler already did that.
// This way we avoid pumping too many action_flags into the pipeline.
// Note that this is based on the idea that NQT will run, on average, n times in n periods - it just may be a little more

// ZZZ addition: adaptive latency mechanism.  Here's the problem.  We want to minimize latency, but also mask
// jitter (i.e. variation in latency).  If we see too much latency, the game will feel "sluggish" in the sense
// that your player will respond late to all your commands - might feel sort of like "driving a boat".
// OTOH if we keep latency at the absolute minimum, we expose ourselves to jitter - if there's a "burp" in
// the system somewhere (either in the network or in an endsystem's scheduling), the game freezes up for the
// duration of that burp.  If small burps happen frequently, we might be better off adding an extra frame of
// latency to smooth over all those little burps.

// Before I begin my changes, let me review how things are working (at least with the way the SDL version
// schedules things).

// If a non-server has a *scheduling* burp, that means we see a too-long period with no calls to NetQueueingTask,
// followed by a bunch of calls to NQT to make up for the losses.

// If a ring packet (maybe more than one, depending on the nature of the burp) arrived and was processed during
// that dry spell, we "smeared" - the packet handler grabbed however many input_flags it needed directly from
// the input system instead of taking from the queue that NQT fills (because the queue was empty/not full enough).
// The extra calls to NQT at the end of the dry spell will go into the regular local_queue, but will probably be
// discarded the next time we feed the ring since we'll have too many flags waiting.

// Endstations upring (i.e. which receive the ring packet later) from the burper will (assuming they are not
// simultaneously burping :) ) queue up a bunch of action_flags as normal in NQT while they wait.  (Note that this also applies to
// a situation where network congestion causes a burp "between" stations - e.g. we have to retransmit due to
// lack of ACK, etc.)  When the ring packet gets around to the next endstations, they will discard the oldest
// action_flags and pass along only the newest few (if my NETWORK_USE_RECENT_FLAGS change is active - it used to
// pass along the oldest ones and throw out the newer ones.)  So far, everything looks peachy - we've had to
// freeze our animation while the burp happened, but at least we're not introducing any new latency (i.e.
// we are making sure our local queue is as empty as possible by throwing away extra flags, etc.)

// The problem comes when we look at the server (and NetServerTask).  It makes no effort to empty its queue
// currently - instead, when the ring comes back to it after a burp, it has a lot of extra flags waiting to
// go.  Instead of ditching the old ones, it sends them _all_ along, and tells the non-servers (via the packet's
// required_action_flags) that they owe a lot of flags.  So, when the ring packet gets to them, and they don't
// have enough flags, they "smear" to make up the difference.  The end result is that a lot of extra flags
// end up in the "player" queue - the one where flags sit after being received from the network but before being acted
// on by the main game code.  The main game takes from that queue only at the TICK rate, so if there are extra
// flags sitting there, any new flags will have to wait to be acted on until they make their way through the
// queue - hello latency.

// Here's my crack at a solution.  The server is responsible for making the decisions here.

// Simply ditching old flags at the server the way we do at endstations seems like the simplest way, but I
// believe it has an important drawback: what if the latency in the ring is greater than the duration of a
// TICK?  What if the average latency in the ring is less than the duration of a TICK, but we tend to jitter
// a fair amount over the TICK duration (but, we hope, not much more)?  In the former case, the game would
// proceed at half the normal TICK rate (or worse) because endstations would be constantly starved for data,
// and thus would be stalling the game all the time.  In the latter case, we wouldn't be stalling *all* the
// time, but every time we jittered past the TICK duration - too frequently to make playing pleasant.

// What we need is to adapt to the network conditions - if we seem to be starving a lot, we want to bump up
// the number of action_flags in our queues so we can use the extras to smooth over the gaps.  OTOH though
// if conditions improve, we want to reduce the number of flags so we don't have gratuitous extra latency
// between player inputs and screen updates.  I think one could argue that the code I inherited did the
// first part just fine, but never readjusted the queue size back down to remove latency when possible.
// (Perhaps this is what Jason's comment in the header means?  "(can only be adjusted upward, not downward)")

// Maybe on the cooperatively-scheduled Mac, using very-low-latency interrupts to do time-sensitive processing,
// burps were uncommon.  But on most systems, our code will probably get scheduled erraticly, so we need to
// be more jitter-tolerant.  In particular, we don't want a big burp to build a whole bunch of latency in
// to the rest of the game, if we can recover from it (exposing ourselves to another big burp later, but we
// hope that those are uncommon enough that we'd rather have a responsive game between stalls than a sluggish
// game that is unaffected by stalls).

// Actually this is all building a compelling argument for changing from a ring to a star, since endstation
// latency in a star has much less impact on the overall system (which here I use to mean all machines involved)
// that does endstation latency in a ring, especially as the number of endstations grows.

// So here's how my scheme works: we maintain a sampling window of how many TICKs it's actually taken the ring
// to go around (remember, this is all done by the server).  As this window slides along in time, we track
// (1) the number of rings that needed more time than we're currently allowing, and
// (2) the number of rings that actually needed the amount of time we're allowing (i.e. that were not 'early'
// by a tick or more).
// If (1) exceeds some threshhold, we add in another required_action_flag, so the queue grows a little longer
// to tolerate constant latency or frequent jitter.
// OTOH if (2) is less than some threshhold, we reduce the number of required_action_flags, so the queue
// shrinks and we have less overall latency.
// Update: instead of using the count of rings that were early or late, we just use the average ring latency
// and compare it to our current setting.  That way we can reuse our window data without having to go
// touch all the samples to recalculate stuff.  (Not that it would really take all *that* long, but...)

// I use these same things, slightly differently in the code, to do NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY_2 (see below).

// to meet our requirement (which is fine) - but then when they run their NetQueueingTask, they'll try to pay back for the smear,
// which means they'll have to smear again next time... it's not the end of the world, but it defeats the purpose of calling NQT

// OK OK I convinced myself.  Disabling FAUX_QUEUE.  That didn't help with erratic server scheduling anyway.
#endif//NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY || NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY_2

// Adaptive latency take 2... heh heh...
// Here's the problem with the first effort.  (Or second, if you count FAUX_QUEUE as an effort.)
// It assumes that the engine consumes action_flags at a constant rate, and in particular that if
// the engine starves, it does not take any special steps to catch up later.  Au contraire!, it turns
// out (quite sensibly) that the engine, after starving, consumes action_flags voraciously to try to
// catch back up to real game time.  So let's try this analysis:

// Endstations produce action_flags at a constant, but perhaps jittery, rate of one per GAME_TICK.
// Endstations consume action_flags at a constant, but perhaps jittery, rate of one per GAME_TICK.

// If the ring gets held up somewhere, endstations build up flags in their local_queues.
// The next time it comes around *after reaching the server*, the ring will consume all the extras.
// Observe: this means that, ideally, we should *not* discard action_flags from the local_queue if
// we get the ring packet and we have more than it wants - it should gobble up our extras next time.
// We *could* make sure our extras get eaten - we could increment a counter for every ring that leaves
// us with flags still in our local_queue.  (When a ring leaves us empty, we reset the counter.)
// We could consider incrementing the counter by the NUMBER of flags we have left sitting around, so if
// we have somehow gotten a large number jammed in our queue, it corrects more quickly.
// If the counter exceeds a threshhold, we throw away an action_flag from the head of the queue (stale)
// and reset the counter.
// If an endstation takes too long between flag productions, it "smears" when the ring reaches it.
// The endstation thus produces too many flags.  If we use the above correction mechanism, we will
// compensate eventually by throwing out extra flags.  But if for some reason drift has caused our
// average rate to fall slightly below what's needed, the extra flag or two from smearing will bring
// our production back up to the needed rate - and that in a timely manner.

// Endstations that take too long between consumption binges build up flags in their player_queues.
// At the next consumption binge, they will eat all the extras.  Note that consumption is tied
// directly to production on an endstation - if the production element runs dry for a while, the consumer
// will not be allowed to consume, even if there are queued flags (in player_queues) available.

// A one-time dry spell and then compensating deluge in the player_queues will be correctly handled by
// the voracious-consumer approach.  The game will freeze up during the dry spell, then suddenly lurch
// ahead several frames to get back to the "present".
// It seems like there could be a problem if the consumer drifts from what's coming to it, but I think
// that having the consumer rate tied to the producer rate - and having everyone agree on that rate by
// the server dictating the net_time - gets around any such problems.

// Actually, I think we should see the following behaviors with regard to net_time:

// If the server's net_time coming in is greater than ours, we should see ourselves smear... unless we recently
// saw a server net_time less than ours, in which case we have queued flags to make up the difference.
// If the server's net_time coming in is less than ours, we should see ourselves ditch a flag.
// (Note that these may not happen at the same packet arrival, but should be nonetheless linked.)

// I have now implemented the flag ditching mechanism outlined above:
#ifdef	NETWORK_SMARTER_FLAG_DITCHING
static int	sFlagDitchingCounter;		// reset if local_queue empties; increments by local_queue leftovers otherwise.

enum {
	kFlagDitchingThreshhold = TICKS_PER_SECOND	// if counter exceeds this, ditch a flag and reset counter.
};
#endif
// We're really splitting hairs at this point.  I think this is only better than the Bungie mechanism if
// we have several late packets in a row followed by a return to normal - and even then we're just honoring
// the user's input a little more accurately.  Oh well, this was probably a poorly spent 15 minutes, but it
// can only help, I think...
// I can convince myself of some pretty odd things if I think about them long enough.  ;)

// Does the net_time mechanism alone solve everything??

// dynamic_world is not allowed to get ahead of net_time.
// Suppose we see a ring packet every three GAME_TICKs.  The ring packet should carry three action_flags with it.
// Let's watch the action starting at 0 (this may not be EXACTLY what the ring protocol does, since it has special
// startup stuff, but if this bothers you, imagine the latency suddenly jumps up to this level at some time T.
// Our "0", then, is the offset from some point in time T.):

// NQT queues a local flag.  Our local net_time increases.  Consumer tries to update dynamic_world, but there's not
// enough data.
// Same thing.  Now local net_time is 2, and there are 2 flags in local_queue.  player_queue is still empty, so
// dynamic_world cannot update.
// Same thing.  net_time is 3, there are 3 flags in local_queue, and player_queue is empty.  dynamic_world is oddly still.
// The ring packet comes in!  It has a required_flags of 1, and every player's data in the packet has 1 flag in it.
// The server's net time was 1 when the packet was sent.  *We set our local net_time to 1.*  We move a local_flag into the
// packet and pass the ring on.  net_time is 1, there are 2 flags in local_queue, and player_queue has 1.
// NQT queues a local flag.  net_time is 2.  There are 3 flags in local_queue.
// dynamic_world updates to time 1 - it could try to go to 2, but there's only 1 flag.  player_queue is now empty.
// NQT queues a local flag.  net_time is 3.  There are 4 flags in local_queue.  player_queue is empty.  dynamic_world is stopped.
// NQT queues a local flag.  net_time is 4.  There are 5 flags in local_queue.  player_queue is empty.  dynamic_world is stopped.
// The ring packet comes in!  required_flags is 3; every player has 3 flags.  The server's net_time was 4.
// Our net_time agrees with the server's.  We pack up 3 local_flags for the packet and pass it on.
// net_time = 4, |local_queue| = 2, |player_queue| = 3, DWTC = 1.
// dynamic_world wants to update to time 4, and CAN - it voraciously consumes all 3 player_flags.
// net_time = 4, |local_queue| = 2, |player_queue| = 0, DWTC = 4.
// NQT: net_time = 5, |local_queue| = 3, |player_queue| = 0, DWTC = 4.
// NQT: net_time = 6, |local_queue| = 4, |player_queue| = 0, DWTC = 4.

// DRAW net_time = 7, |local_queue| = 2, |player_queue| = 0, DWTC = 7.

// Note: if latency suddenly drops back to 1 GAME_TICK per ring, the extra flags in local_queue will drain, and DWTC
// will be able to track net_time more closely.
// If instead latency stays high, we will eventually discard the extra elements in local_queue, reducing overall
// user-input-to-screen-update latency.

// Note: if bandwidth is no problem but latency is high ("long fat pipe"?), we could have multiple updates "on the wire"
// at a time, thus letting DWTC remain in sync with net_time -> smoother updates.  Our net_time would stay a few ticks
// behind the server's net_time.

// OK, this behavior is not so good because we're only drawing the screen at 10fps (once every 3 GAME_TICKs).
// Options are to speculatively update dynamic_world, thus letting DWTC track net_time (but without "real data" to go on), (HARD),
// or to delay the engine's view of net_time by some amount (EASY), introducing even more latency but smoothing out the frames.

// How do we decide to raise or lower the amount of delay?
// Should be based on, when a packet comes in, how many player_flags there are?  How DWTC compares to (net_time - delay)?
