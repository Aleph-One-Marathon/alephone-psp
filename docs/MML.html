<title>The Marathon Markup Language</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The Marathon Markup Language (MML), a subset of the Extensible Markup Language (XML):
This was created for the purpose of configuring the Marathon engine in a non-hardcoded way.
On the MacOS version of Aleph One, MML scripts are stored as TEXT resources
in the Aleph One app which are accessed in increasing order of ID. On the
SDL version of Aleph One, the scripts are stored in "MML" subdirectories of
the local and global data directories and accessed in alphabetical order
(scripts in the local directory are read after the global ones so they can
override their settings).
<p>

For more on XML, check out these links:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.xml.com">xml.com; has lots of XML-related stuff</a>
<li><a href="http://www.trafficstudio.com/sixpack">Sixpack, a MacOS-native XML editor</a>
</ul>

One feature that I've attempted to maintain is that any set of values
can always be overrode by another.
For example, if you set some color to be red in one file,
and that color to be green in a file processed after it,
that color will be green.
<p>

Many of the element attributes here are some sort of index value,
and they are all counted from 0 unless specified otherwise;
for example, collections are numbered from 0 to 31.
But one problem that I currently face is that
the lists in this document are shown as starting from 1 instead of 0.
I'm not sure how to correct that without numbering the items by hand;
this document contains the kludge of adding 1000.
<p>


Here is the format:
<p>

<h3><a name="marathon">Marathon Root Element: &lt;marathon&gt;</a></h3>

This is the root element, the one that contains all the others.
Other Marathon-related root elements may be defined in the future, however,
such as root elements for stuff that is intended for individual map levels.
These may have a format like &lt;maralevel index="value"&gt;.
<p>

This element has no attributes and contains these child elements:

<h3><a name="stringset">String-Set Element: &lt;stringset&gt;</a></h3>

This element is an imitation of MacOS 'STR#' resources. It has an attribute of "index",
which has a numerical value corresponding to the original resource ID:

<ul>
<li>128: Errors
<li>129: Filenames
<li>130: Top-Level Interface Items
<li>131: Prompts
<li>132: Network Errors
<li>133: Key Codes to Names
<li>134: Preferences Advice
<li>135: Computer Interface
<li>136: Join Dialog Messages
<li>137: Weapon Names
<li>138: File Search Path
<li>139: Preferences Groupings
<li>140: Postgame Network Game Statistics
<li>141: Net Game Setup
<li>142: New Join Dialog Messages
<li>143: Progress Strings for Networking
<li>145: Difficulty Level Names</li>

<li>151: Item types
<li>152: Player and Team Color Names</li>
<li>153: Net Statistics Strings
<li>200: OpenGL-Option Color-Picker Prompts
</ul>

This element contains child elements with form &lt;string&gt;,
which have an attribute of "index",
and contents of whatever the string is supposed to be.
The index is zero-based, unlike the original STR# resources, whose indices are one-based.
For example, the filenames are specified in this fashion:

<pre>
&lt;!-- STR# Resource: "Filenames" --&gt;
&lt;stringset index="129"&gt;
&lt;string index="0"&gt;Shapes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="1"&gt;Shapes.16&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="2"&gt;Sounds&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="3"&gt;Sounds.16&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="4"&gt;Aleph One Preferences&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="5"&gt;Map&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="6"&gt;Untitled Game&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="7"&gt;Marathon&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="8"&gt;Aleph One Recording&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="9"&gt;Physics Model&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="10"&gt;Music&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="11"&gt;Images&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="12"&gt;Movie&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/stringset&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="interface">Interface-Stuff Element: &lt;interface&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies stuff used in the heads-up display (HUD).
It has one attribute, "motion_sensor", which is <a href="#boolean">boolean</a>,
and which indicates whether or not the motion sensor will be active.
In what follows, the HUD coordinates used will be x = rightward and y = downward,
with the HUD's top left corner being at x = 0, y = 320.
This element also contains these kinds of child elements:
<ul>
<li>&lt;rect&gt;, with all interface rectangles;
it contains the attributes
<ul>
<li> index, others are short integers

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;string index="1"&gt;must take the oath of the vidmaster:&lt;/string&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;string index="2"&gt;&lt;/string&gt; &lt;!-- empty string for line break --&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;!-- [QUOTE] at string's start makes Aleph One use a different text style --&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;string index="3"&gt;[QUOTE]"I pledge to punch all switches,&lt;/string&gt;

<h3><a name="motsens">Motion-Sensor Element: &lt;motion_sensor&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for assigning motion-sensor features;
the assignment is done by doing &lt;assign&gt;, which has attributes "monster"
(which one of these in the list) and "type", which is
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Self, Friendly Player, and Bob
<li>Alien
<li>Hostile Player
</ol>
<p>

One can disable it by specifying that the top-level element
<a href="#interface">&lt;interface&gt;</a>
has attribute "motion_sensor" with value "false".
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ovhdmap">Overhead-Map Element: &lt;overhead_map&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for setting up overhead-map features.
It can have an attribute of "mode", which has possible values:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Normal: automapping is cumulative (the default)
<li>Currently visible only
<li>All
</ol>
<p>

It can also have the attribute "title_offset", whose value is how many pixels downward
to offset the title text.
<p>

One can assign various types to monsters; they can either never show up,
or else show up as a Bob or as an alien.
This must be done separately for living and dead monsters,
because the engine "forgets" what monster type a dead monster is.
<p>

Thus, one assigns live monsters with &lt;assign_live&gt; and dead ones with
&lt;assign_dead&gt;.
Which live monster to assign one specifies with an attribute "monster",
which takes a monster type, while which dead monster to assign one specified
with an attribute of "coll", which takes a collection ID.
Both elements assign to a type of display, specified with attribute "type";
the possible types are:
<ul>
<li>-1(NONE): won't ever show up
<li> 0: Bob (shown by default)
<li> 1: Alien (not shown by default)
</ul>
<p>

One can display additional stuff by specifying an appropriate element;
this elements have an attribute of "on", which is a 
<a href="#boolean">boolean</a> value.
<ul>
<li>&lt;aliens&gt;: shows characters other than players and Bobs
<li>&lt;items&gt;: shows anything that can be picked up
<li>&lt;projectiles&gt;: shows these
<li>&lt;paths&gt;: shows the paths that the monster AI has worked out
</ul>
<p>

Lines can be specified with the element &lt;line&gt;, which has these attributes,
all mandatory:
<ul>
<li>type:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Wall (solid)
<li>Elevation (not solid; floor on one side higher than on the other side)
<li>Control panel
</ol>
<li>scale: 0 is minimum map scale and 3 is maximum map scale
<li>width: width value in pixels
</ul>

Colors can be specified with the element &lt;color&gt;, which is indexed;
For more on specifying colors, go <a href="#color">here</a>.
Here are what the colors are:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Plain polygon
<li>Platform
<li>Water
<li>Lava
<li>Sewage
<li>JjaroGoo
<li>PfhorSlime

</ol>
<p>

Fonts can be specified with the element &lt;font&gt;, which is indexed;
For more on specifying fonts, go <a href="#font">here</a>.
Here are what the fonts are:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Annotation at scale 0 (lowest)
<li>Annotation at scale 1
<li>Annotation at scale 2
<li>Annotation at scale 3 (highest)
<li>Map title
</ol>

One can disable it by specifying that the top-level element
<a href="#view">&lt;view&gt;</a>
has attribute "map" with value "false".
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="infravision">Infravision Element: &lt;infravision&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element contains what is needed to specify infravision colors.
These are assigned by texture collection, and there are 4 colors to choose from.
The assignment is done with element &lt;assign&gt;, which has the attributes
"coll" (for collection) and "color" (for which one of the colors).
Here are the default colors:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Aliens (red)
<li>Friends and Items (green)
<li>Walls and Scenery, also the S'pht (blue)
<li>Player Stuff and Explosion Effects (yellow)
</ol>
Colors can be specified with the element &lt;color&gt;, which is indexed;
For more on specifying colors, go <a href="#color">here</a>.
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="animtxtrs">Animated-Textures Element: &lt;animated_textures&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for specifying animated textures.
Animated textures are specified as sequences, which contain loops of texture frames
and various timing and phase information.
For example, suppose that a sequence contains frames (a,b,c).
As time goes on, frame a will be translated first into frame a, then into frame b,
then into frame c, and then will repeat the sequence, as shown below:
<p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>c</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

This element has two kinds of child elements, &lt;clear&gt; and &lt;sequence&gt;.
<p>

The first one, &lt;clear&gt;, clears the sequences; if it has an attribute of "coll",
it will clear the sequences for the collection specified in that attribute's value;
if not, it will clear all the sequences.
However, this command can be followed by commands to create sequences,
which will then be executed as if no "clear" command had been issued.
<p>

The second one, &lt;sequence&gt;, specifies the sequences themselves.
It takes these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (mandatory)
<li>numticks: how many engine ticks to stay at each frame (mandatory)
<lI>framephase: how many frames ahead to start (optional: default = 0)
<li>tickphase: how many ticks into a frame to start (optional: default = 0)
<li>select: for choosing some frame to translate into the loop of frames
as if it was the first one; this frame need not be a member of the loop.
If this is -1, then it is the frames in the loop that are translated.
(optional: default = -1; use the loop frames)
</ul>
<p>

This one also contains a child element, &lt;frame&gt;, which has a mandatory
attribute of "index", which is the frame's index.
There must be at least one of these in a sequence, for rather obvious reasons.
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="controlpanels">Control-Panels Element: &lt;control_panels&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies various control-panel features,
such as what kind it is, what items it accepts, and so forth.
It has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>reach: the maximum distance one can reach to touch a control panel,
in World Units (default: 1.5)
<li>horiz: how compressed-to-horizontal the reaching must be;
no compression is 1 (default: 2)
<li>single_energy: how much the single-energy panel recharges (default: 150)
<li>single_energy_rate: the single-energy panel's recharge rate (default: 1)
<li>double_energy: how much the double-energy panel recharges (default: 300)
<li>double_energy_rate: the double-energy panel's recharge rate (default: 2)
<li>triple_energy: how much the triple-energy panel recharges (default: 450)
<li>triple_energy_rate: the triple-energy panel's recharge rate (default: 3)
</ul>
<p>

Each kind of control panel is specified with the child element
&lt;panel&gt;, which has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the types of control panel (mandatory)
<li>type: what that control panel does
<li>coll: which shapes collection
<li>active_frame: which frame when the panel is active
<li>inactive_frame: which frame when the panel is inactive
<li>pitch: what pitch of panel-active sound
<li>item: what item the panel accepts (-1 is none)
</ul>
This element has an optional child element, "sound", with two attributes,
both mandatory: type and which.
The type indicates when the sound is to play, while which is the index in
the list of sound definitions (-1 means none).
<p>

The map files themselves reference control panels by definition;
here are the default control-panel definitions:

<p>

It has child elements that specify which ambient and random sound assignments to use,
and also which external files to use, if desired.
The ambient and random sound assigments
are assignments from their indices to the list of (general) sound definitions,
and are specified with child elements &lt;ambient&gt; and &lt;random&gt;.
Each of them has these attributes, both mandatory:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the ambient or random sound types

<h3><a name="faders">Fader Elements: &lt;faders&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for specifying various fader features,
the faders being what causes the whole screen to change color
when one is underneath a liquid or getting hit by something.
It has two kinds of child elements, &lt;fader&gt; and &lt;liquid&gt;.
<p>

The first kind, &lt;fader&gt;, specifies features of each individual fader;
it has attributes
<ul>
<li>index: which fader
<li>type: which type of fade effect to apply
<li>initial_opacity (floating point: 0 = none, 1 = complete)
<li>final_opacity (floating point: 0 = none, 1 = complete)
<li>period: time for fader effect to complete, in engine ticks (1/30 second)
<li>flags: various features; get this value by adding the numerical values
corresponding to the desired features:
<ul>
<li><tt>1 (hex 0001)</tt> Full screen
<li><tt>2 (hex 0002)</tt> Random transparency; makes flickering effect
</ul>
<li>priority: higher is higher priority
</ul>
and a child element &lt;color&gt;, which is not indexed.
For more on specifying colors, go <a href="#color">here</a>.
The fader types are these:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Tint: fade to the fader's color value:<br>
[new color] = [old color] + ([fader color] - [old color])*[opacity]
<li>Randomize: do random shifts of the colors:<br>
[new color] = [old color] + [opacity]*[random numbers]
<li>Negate: darkens light colors and lightens dark colors. For each channel:<br>
[opacity complement] = 1 - [opacity]<br>
if [old color] &gt; 0.5 then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[new color] = max([old color], xor([fader color], [old color]) + [opacity complement])<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[new color] = min([old color], xor([fader color], [old color]) - [opacity complement])<br>
Intermediate results may be out of (0,1) range.
<li>Dodge: some weird processing. For each channel:<br>
[new color] = max([old color], 1 - (1 - [fader color])*[old color] - [opacity])<br>
Intermediate results may be out of (0,1) range.
<li>Burn: some weird processing. For each channel:<br>
[opacity complement] = 1 - [opacity]<br>
[new color] = max([old color],[fader color]*[old color] + [opacity complement])<br>
Intermediate results may be out of (0,1) range.
<li>Soft tint: fade to the fader's color value multiplied by the intensity
(maximum of color-channel values):<br>
[intensity] = max(color channels of [old color])<br>
[new color] = [old color] + ([fader color]*[intensity] - [old color])*[opacity]
</ol>
In all these equations, color values are from 0 (black) to 1 (white),
and out-of-range result values are reduced to that range by subtracting whichever integer
will put the result into that range.
<p>

The second kind, &lt;liquid&gt;, specifies faders for liquids;
it has attributes
<ul>
<li>index: which liquid to apply the fader to
<li>fader: this specifies which fader to use for this liquid.
<li>opacity: how strong is the fader effect (floating point: 0 = none, 1 = complete)
</ul>
The index is which one of these liquid types:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Water
<li>Lava
<li>Sewage
<li>Jjaro
<li>Pfhor
</ol>
<p>

<li> 8: Flaming death
</ul>
</ul>
If there is none of something, then it gets a value of -1.

<li>extravision (default: 5400 or 3 minutes)
<li>infravision (default: 5400 or 3 minutes)
</ul>
These have a value of the number of engine ticks the powerup lasts;
an engine tick is 1/30 second.

with the <a href="#items">items</a> element.
<p>

Player shapes can be set with an element of &lt;shape&gt;, which differs from the usual element with that name;
the player shapes have an overall collection and various sequences,
and each element will set either that collection or one of the sequences.
It has these attributes, all of which are mandatory:
<ul>
<li>type: overall type of shape value

<hr>

<h3><a name="scenery">Scenery Element: &lt;scenery&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies various features of scenery objects,
including size and solidity.
Each individual type of scenery object is specified with a &lt;object&gt; child element,
which has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the scenery-object types (mandatory)
<li>flags: various features; get this value by adding the numerical values
corresponding to the desired features:
<ul>
<li><tt>1 (hex 0001)</tt> Solid (can't pass through it)
<li><tt>2 (hex 0002)</tt> Animated
<li><tt>4 (hex 0004)</tt> Destroyable
</ul>
<li>radius: horizontal dimension in internal units, for doing collision detection.
<li>height: vertical dimension like above; if negative,
then object's extent downward from reference point (good for ceiling objects).
<li>destruction: effect to make when destroyed (-1 is none).
</ul>
<p>

This element's shapes can be specified with child elements
&lt;normal&gt; and &lt;destroyed&gt;, for before-and-after shapes;
each of them has the actual shape value specified with a
<a href="#shape">shape</a> child element.
<p>

Some notes on the flags:
<p>

"Animated" isn't really used by the engine;
the engine reads the animations off of the sequences without reference to it.
<p>

"Destroyable" is not meaningful unless the object is also "solid";
this is because a projectile must collide with the object in order to destroy it.
Thus, a solid but indestructible object would get flags="1",
and a destroyable one would get flags="5".
<p>

The index is which one of these scenery-object types:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Lava: light dirt
<li>Lava: dark dirt
<li>Lava: bones
<li>Lava: bone
<li>Lava: ribs

<h3><a name="landscapes">Landscapes Element: &lt;landscapes&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for modifying landscape rendering.

This element has two kinds of child elements, &lt;clear&gt; and &lt;landscape&gt;.
<p>

The first one, &lt;clear&gt;, clears the landscape options,
setting them back to their defaults; if it has an attribute of "coll",
it will clear the sequences for the collection specified in that attribute's value;
if not, it will clear all the sequences.
However, this command can be followed by commands to set up landscape options,
which will then be executed as if no "clear" command had been issued.
<p>

The second one, &lt;landscape&gt;, specifies the landscape options themselves.
It takes these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (mandatory)
<li>frame: which frame to apply the options to (default: -1, all frames)
<li>horiz_exp: exponent for power of 2 that is the number of wraparound repeats in the horizontal direction.
(default: 1 - two repeats)
<li>vert_exp: exponent for power of 2 that makes a vertical scaling equal to the scaling
produced by the same value of horiz_exp in the horizontal direction. (default: 1 - equal to two horizontal repeats)
<li>ogl_asprat_exp: exponent for power of 2 that is the ratio of width to height
of the part of the texture that OpenGL will use (width is fixed; height can be variable).
This part will always be centered in height, and will either include some untextured area
or will not include the top and bottom parts. (default: 1 -- height is 1/2 width)
<li>vert_repeat: whether texture repeats in the vertical direction
(default: false -- clamped in the vertical direction; last pixels stretched out)
<li>azimuth: angle in degrees to rotate the texture leftward relative to the map.
This could be useful for aligning landscape features with map ones. (default: 0)
</ul>
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="textureloading">Texture-Loading Element: &lt;texture_loading&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for setting what textures are to be loaded.
It has one attribute, "landscapes",  which is <a href="#boolean">boolean</a>;
it indicates whether or not to load M2/Moo-style landscapes (collections 26 to 30).
It also has a child element, &lt;texture_env&gt;, for indicating what wall-texture and
scenery collections are to be loaded.
It takes these attributes, all mandatory:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the texture environments (water, lava, sewage, etc.)
<li>which: which position in the texture-environment definition (0 = first, etc;).
There are currently 7 such positions available.
<li>coll: which collection in that position; -1 is no collection.
</ul>
<p>

The defaults for Marathon 2/oo are, in order (walls, scenery):
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>17, 22 -- Lh'owon Water
<li>18, 23 -- Lh'owon Lava
<li>19, 24 -- Lh'owon Sewage
<li>20, 25 -- Jjaro
<li>21, 26 -- Pfhor
</ol>
<p>

Those for Marathon 1 are, in order (walls, control panels, scenery):
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>17, 8, 23 -- Marathon Set 1
<li>18, 8, 23 -- Marathon Set 2
<li>19, 8, 23 -- Marathon Set 3
<li>2, 24, 25 -- Pfhor
</ol>
<p>

Note also that Marathon 1 has its landscapes in the wall-texture collections;
the attribute "landscapes" is to be false for it.

<h3><a name="opengl">OpenGL-Rendering Element: &lt;opengl&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for modifying the OpenGL rendering.
Currently, both texture-rendering modification and fog are supported;
texture-rendering modification modifies the rendering of each bitmap.

This element has these kinds of child elements, &lt;txtr_clear&gt;, &lt;texture&gt;,
&lt;model_clear&gt;, &lt;model&gt;, and &lt;fog&gt;.
<p>

The first one, &lt;txtr_clear&gt;, clears the texture options,
setting them back to their defaults. If it has an attribute of "coll",
it will clear the sequences for the collection specified in that attribute's value;
if not, it will clear all the sequences.
However, this command can be followed by commands to set up texture options,
which will then be executed as if no "txtr_clear" command had been issued.
<p>

The next one, &lt;texture&gt;, specifies the texture options themselves.
It takes these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (mandatory).
<li>clut: which color table. Values 0 to 7 are the familiar color-table values,
and there are these special values:
<ul>
<li>All color tables: -1 (default)
<li>Infravision: 8
<li>Silhouette: 9 [used for invisibility and static effect]
</ul>
<li>bitmap: which one to apply the options to (mandatory).
<li>opac_type: what type of opacity to use (default: 0 -- crisp edges).
<li>opac_scale: scaling value for the opacity;
how much to multiply it by (default: 1 -- no change).
<li>opac_shift: shift value for the opacity;
how much to add after multiplying (default: 0 -- no change).
<li>void_visible: can see into the void (what's not in any map polygon) through this texture;
can cause smearing and weird show-through (default: false; cannot see into void).
<li>normal_image: the name of the file whose image content to substitute
in "normal" rendering (sensitive to light levels).
<li>normal_mask: the name of the file whose image content becomes the opacity mask
for "normal" rendering (sensitive to light levels).
It must be used with a normal_image file.
<li>glow_image: the name of the file whose image content to substitute
in "glowing" rendering (independent of light levels).
<li>glow_mask: the name of the file whose image content becomes the opacity mask
for "glowing" rendering (independent of light levels).
It must be used with a glow_image file.
<li>normal_blend: which blend mode for semitransparent normal textures (default: 0 -- crossfade)
<li>glow_blend: which blend mode for semitransparent glowing textures (default: 0 -- crossfade)
<li>image_scale: The amount to scale a substituted sprite, from pixel units to internal distance units.
If it is zero or less, then it and the offsets are ignored.
<li>x_offset: The amount to shift the top left corner rightward, in internal units.
<li>y_offset: The amount to shift the top left corner downward, in internal units. 
</ul>
<p>
Note: all resulting values will be pegged to the range 0 to 1.
Here are the various opacity types:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Crisp edges. The opacity threshold is 0.5.
<li>Fuzzy edges.
<li>Fuzzy edges with opacity = average of color channels.
<li>Fuzzy edges with opacity = maximum of color channels.
</ol>
Here are the various blend types, to be used for semitransparent rendering:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Crossfade blending; reasonable for semitransparent, non-glowing object
<li>Additive blending; reasonable for glowing, low-opacity object
</ol>
<p>

The opacities of all but the first will be scaled and shifted
with opac_scale and opac_shift.
The first one of these is good for objects with well-defined edges;
the others are good for clouds, flames, energy-weapon bolts, and so forth,
which will not have sharp boundaries.
The average and maximum modes were included as a way of producing variable opacity
without adding any new files; this hack was inspired by the semitransparency handling
in the Tomb Raider series.
The idea here is that the brighter regions are likely to be the more opaque ones
in these cases.
I've put both of them in because they behave somewhat differently;
max has the same strength for saturated colors as for grays,
while mean has less strength for saturated colors than for grays.
<p>

The next one, &lt;model_clear&gt;, clears all the model definitions;
it works much like &lt;txtr_clear&gt;.
<p>

The next one, &lt;model&gt; specifies a 3D model to be used in place
of some sequence. Models can either be static, having no built-in animations
(most 3D-model formats), or they can be dynamic, having such animations
(Brian Barnes's Dim3 model format, for example).
These animations are specified by sequence (animation in BB's terminology);
each sequence should have at least one frame.
There is one special "sequence", the neutral pose, which indicates a model
with no animations applied.
This element takes child elements &lt;seq_map&gt; and &lt;skin&gt;, and these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (mandatory).
<li>seq: which sequence in the Marathon engine.
Checked after the sequence mapping is searched for a sequence;
it may be omitted if a sequence mapping is being used.
Recommended for use with static models;
for dynamic models, it maps onto the model's neutral pose.
<li>file: the name of the file containing the model data.
For static models, this is the only file,
for Dim3 models, this is the "mesh" file (basic model data).
<li>file1: an extra model-data file. Unnecessary for static models;
for Dim3 models, this is the "pose" file (frames).
<li>file2: an extra model-data file. Unnecessary for static models;
for Dim3 models, this is the "animate" file (sequences).
<li>type: a string identifying the model-data format:
<ul>
<li>Alias|Wavefront Object: "wave" to "wavefront"
<li>3D Studio Max Object: "3ds" to "3ds max" or "3dsmax"
<li>QuickDraw 3D / Quesa 3D Metafile: "qd3d" or "3dmf" or "quesa"
<li>Brian Barnes Dim3 animated model: "dim3"
</ul>
If it is absent, the type will then be guessed from the file contents,
an operation that may work on some file formats but not others.
<li>scale: how much to scale the model before rendering,
from model coordinates to internal coordinates.
A negative scale will cause the model to be reflected around all three axes
(default: 1).
<li>x_rot: rotation in degrees around the x-axis (default: 0).
<li>y_rot: rotation in degrees around the y-axis (default: 0).
<li>z_rot: rotation in degrees around the z-axis (default: 0).
<li>x_shift: shift in internal units in the x direction (default: 0).
<li>y_shift: shift in internal units in the y direction (default: 0).
<li>z_shift: shift in internal units in the z direction (default: 0).
<li>side: which side is visible (default: clockwise):
<ul>
<li>+: clockwise side
<li>0: both sides
<li>-: counterclockwise side
</ul>
<li>norm_type: which sort of normals to use for doing the lighting (default: originals)
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>None
<li>Original-model normals (may be none)
<li>Reverse-direction original-model normals (may be none)
<li>Normals in the direction of the polygons' clockwise sides
<li>Normals in the direction of the polygons' counterclockwise sides
</ol>
<li>norm_split: threshold for spltting the vertex normals
for clockwise-side or counterclockwise-side normals;
if the normals' standard deviation is greater than this value,
then a vertex's normal is split into one for each of its polygons.
(default: 0.5)
<li>light_type: what sort of lighting to use (default: fast)
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Fast lighting; only one calculation of the player light
<li>Like above, but the player light won't fade off on the sides
<li>Individual-vertex calculation of the player light (more accurate, but slower)
<li>Like above, but the player light won't fade off on the sides
</ol>
<li>depth_type: what sort of depth to use in the depth sorting
<ul>
<li>+: Farthest bounding-box point (good for all-or-nothing-opacity objects)
<li>0: Center of bounding box
<li>-: Nearest bounding-box point (good for semitransparent objects)
</ul>
Ideally, objects with all-or-nothing opacity ought to be rendered
before semitransparent ones;
these different depth options offer a way to approximate that effect.
</ul>
<p>
The scaling and rotations will be applied before the shifts;
the rotations will be applied in order x, y, and z.
<p>

Its child element of &lt;seq_map&gt; is the sequence-mapping element,
has these attributes, both mandatory:
<ul>
<li>seq: sequence in the Marathon engine to map to.
<li>model_seq: sequence in the model, starting from 0.
The model sequence -1 is the neutral pose.
</ul>
A model element can have several such elements,
covering many of a collection's sequences.
<p>

The model element's child element of &lt;skin&gt; has these attributes,
which closely parallel those of &lt;texture&gt;:
<ul>
<li>clut: which color table (default: -1 -- all of them).
<li>opac_type: what type of opacity to use (default: 0 -- crisp edges).
<li>opac_scale: scaling value for the opacity;
how much to multiply it by (default: 1 -- no change).
<li>opac_shift: shift value for the opacity;
how much to add after multiplying (default: 0 -- no change).
<li>normal_image: the name of the file whose image content to substitute
in "normal" rendering (sensitive to light levels).
<li>normal_mask: the name of the file whose image content becomes the opacity mask
for "normal" rendering (sensitive to light levels).
It must be used with a normal_image file.
<li>glow_image: the name of the file whose image content to substitute
in "glowing" rendering (independent of light levels).
<li>glow_mask: the name of the file whose image content becomes the opacity mask
for "glowing" rendering (independent of light levels).
It must be used with a glow_image file.
<li>normal_blend: which blend mode for semitransparent normal textures (default: 0 -- crossfade)
<li>glow_blend: which blend mode for semitransparent glowing textures (default: 0 -- crossfade)
</ul>
<p>

The final one, &lt;fog&gt;, has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>type: which type of fog:
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Above liquid
<li>Below liquid
</ol>
The default is 0 (above liquid).
<li>on: (<a href="#boolean">boolean</a>; default: false)
<li>depth: the fog depth in World Units (default: 8)
<li>landscapes: whether this fog affects landscape textures (default: true)
</ul>
<p>

and a <a href="#color">color</a> subelement, which indicates the fog color
(default: gray [red = green = blue = 0.5]).
<p>

<h3><a name="dynlims">Dynamic-Limits Element: &lt;dynamic_limits&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies various dynamic limits,
more specifically, the maximum numbers of various entities whose quantity
varies during the game.
These are specified with various child elements, each one of which
has a mandatory attribute of "value", which is set to the appropriate number.
Here they are:

<ul>
<li> &lt;objects&gt; (default: 1024) Every sort of inhabitant object (players, monsters, items, projectiles, scenery)
<li> &lt;monsters&gt; (default: 512) Monsters / Non-Player Characters (NPC's).
<li> &lt;paths&gt; (default: 128) Paths for NPC's to follow; if not enough, they will not move.
<li> &lt;projectiles&gt; (default: 128) Bullets, missiles, flame, fist punches, etc.
<li> &lt;effects&gt; (default: 128) Explosions, splashes, etc.
<li> &lt;rendered&gt; (default: 1024) How many inhabitants to render at any one time.
<li> &lt;local_collision&gt; (default: 64) Target visibility, NPC-NPC collisions, etc.
<li> &lt;global_collision&gt; (default: 256) Projectiles with other objects
</ul>

&lt;player_name&gt;Marathon Player&lt;/player_name&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="keyboard">Keyboard-Defaults Element: &lt;keyboard&gt;</a></h3>

This element is for setting the default keyboard settings.
It has an attribute "set" which indicates which of the three sets to set keys for
(Standard, Arrows, PowerBook), and a child element &lt;key&gt; with attributes
<ul>
<li> index: which key action
<li> mac: the MacOS key code (*not* ASCII)

<li>Turning Left
<li>Turning Right
<li>Sidestepping Left
<li>Sidestepping Right

<h3><a name="cheats">Cheating Element: &lt;cheats&gt;</a></h3>

This element controls whether or not the engine will respond to the cheat codes;
it has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>on: it is <a href="#boolean">boolean</a> (default: false [cheating off])
<li>mac_keymod: Value that indicates the key modifiers to use in the MacOS version;
these keys must be pressed while typing the cheat code.
</ul>
and this child element: &lt;keyword&gt;, which is for specifying the cheat keywords.
It has a mandatory attribute, "index", and some contained text, as with the text-string elements.
<p>
The MacOS key-modifier code is the sum of these values:
<ul>
<li>Command: 256
<li>Shift: 512
<li>Caps Lock: 1024
<li>Option: 2048
<li>Control: 4096
</ul>
<p>
and defaults to the control key only (4096).
Thus, if one wants the key modifiers to be control+shift,
the "mac_keymod" attribute would get a value of 4096+512 = 4608.
<p>
The cheat-code keywords and their defaults are
<ol type=1 start=1000>
<li>Energy (1x): NRG
<li>Oxygen: OTWO
<li>Map Everything: MAP
<li>Invisible: BYE
<li>Invincible: NUKE
<li>Infravision: SEE
<li>Extravision: WOW
<li>Pistol: MAG
<li>Assault Rifle: RIF
<li>Rocket Launcher: POW
<li>Flamethrower: TOAST
<li>Fusion Gun: MELT
<li>Shotgun: PUFF
<li>SMG: ZIP
<li>Alien weapon: PZBXAY
<li>All weapons' ammo: AMMO
<li>Jump: QWE
<li>Everything (almost): SHIT
<li>Save at this spot: YOURMOM
</ol>
<p>
For example, making the energy cheat into "JUICE" means setting up
<pre>
&lt;keyword index="0"&gt;JUICE&lt;/keyword&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="logging">Logging Configuration Element: &lt;logging&gt;</a></h3>

This element is used to configure Aleph One's logging behavior.  It has no attributes of its own.  Its single child element, &lt;logging_domain&gt;, requests particular logging behaviors for a logging domain.

<p>

The &lt;logging_domain&gt; element has the following attributes:

<ul>
<li>domain (string, required): names the logging domain whose behavior should be modified.  At the moment, the only logging domain is "global", in which all logging is currently done.
<li>threshhold (integer): only log messages at a level strictly lower than (i.e. less detailed than) the threshhold will appear.  See below for information about logging levels.
<li>show_locations (boolean): determines whether log entries will include source code filenames and line numbers.
<li>flush (boolean): determines whether output to the log file should be flushed after every log message (slower) or allowed to sit in a buffer for later writing (faster, but may fail to write log entries just before an application crash).
</ul>

The following are the currently-defined standard log levels:

<ul>
<li>logFatalLevel = 0: program must exit
<li>logErrorLevel = 10: can't do something significant
<li>logWarningLevel = 20: can continue but results could be really screwy
<li>logAnomalyLevel = 30: can continue, results could be off a little, but no big deal
<li>logNoteLevel = 40: something worth mentioning
<li>logTraceLevel = 50: details of actions and logic
<li>logDumpLevel = 60: values of data etc.
</ul>

Note that the &lt;threshhold&gt; attribute requires that the level be specified as an integer (but that it need not equal one of the standard levels), and further that log messages with level exactly equal to the threshhold level will NOT be seen.

<p>

Example:
<pre>
&lt;logging&gt;
&lt;logging_domain domain="global" threshhold="40" show_locations="true" flush="true"/&gt;
&lt;/logging&gt;
</pre>
This would set up the "global" logging domain such that only messages more important than "notes" would be seen; that source code filenames and line numbers would be included in the log; and that the log file would be flushed after every message, so a message logged just before an application crash would appear in the log file.

<h3><a name="levelscripts">Level Scripting</a></h3>

Unlike most MML elements, a level-script element can only live in a map file,
and it must be TEXT resource 128 or some equivalent, in order for its parser
to know where to find it.
Its root element is &lt;marathon_levels&gt; and not
&lt;marathon&gt;, to distinguish it from the usual sort of MML.
<p>

It has child elements &lt;level&gt;, &lt;end&gt;, &lt;default&gt;, &lt;restore&gt;,
and &lt;end_screens&gt;,
all but the last one specify what individual level scripts to execute. The element &lt;level&gt;
has a mandatory attribute, "index", which specifies which level the script is for;
the first one is index 0.
The element &lt;end&gt; specifies a script that is for the end of a game;
The element &lt;default&gt; specifies a script that is for the entire map file;
it is executed before a level's script is executed, for rather obvious reasons.
The element &lt;restore&gt; is intended to restore parameters to their A1 defaults
when switching to another map file; this is done because the parameters that the MML parser sets
are set in a "sticky" fashion,
and because saving and restoring default values inside the code
would require a whole lot of extra coding.
<p>

These elements have child elements that specify the script entries;
the entries are executed in the order that they are specified in the file.
This means that music files played in sequential order will be played in the order
that they are specified in, the first in the list played first, etc.
<ul>
<li>&lt;mml&gt; executes the MML script in the resource specified in the value of the attribute "resource"
<li>&lt;pfhortran&gt; executes the Pfhortran script in the resource specified in the value of the attribute "resource"
<li>&lt;music&gt; plays the music file specified in the value of the attribute "file"
<li>&lt;random_order&gt; has the <a href="#boolean">boolean</a> attribute "on", which indicates whether
the music files are to be played in random order;
if not (the default), they are played in looping sequence.
<li>&lt;movie&gt; plays at the beginning of a level the movie file
specified in the value of the attribute "file".
It has an optional attribute, "size" (default: 2),
which indicates how much the movie is to be scaled when playing back.
</ul>
<p>
Directoris and files are specified in Unix fashion, &lt;dirname&gt;/&lt;dirname&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;,
with a ':' being translated into a '/' in the MacOS.
The root directory for such specifications is the map file's parent directory,
so something like "Music/bang_my_head.mp3" means looking for file "bang_my_head.mp3"
in the directory "Music", which is in the same directory that the map file lives in.
<p>

The MacOS version uses Quicktime for music and movie playing,
meaning that any of these formats can be used:
<ul>
<li>AIFF
<li>Sun's AU
<li>Microsoft's WAVE
<li>MP3
<li>MIDI
</ul>
<p>

Finally, the &lt;end_screens&gt; element is for specifying which PICT resources
are to be used as the end-of-game screen displays.
This specification is done with these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which fake level-index value to use for the end of the game (default: 99);
all chapter screens have the resource ID (1500 + (level index)).
If there is more than one ending chapter screen, then this is for finding the first one.
<li>count: how many in sequence (default: 1), with resource ID's incremented by one for each one.
</ul>
<p>

<h3><a name="appendix1">Appendix 1: Additional Elements</a></h3>

<h4><a name="color">Colors</a></h4>

Colors are specified with the element &lt;color&gt;
colors may be either indexed (being list members), or non-indexed (being in isolation).
The color channels are red, green, and blue, with values that range from 0 to 1.
<ul>
<li>index (mandatory if indexed; must be absent if not indexed)
<li>red
<li>green
<li>blue
</ul>
All the color-channel attributes (red, green, blue) are mandatory.
This example makes color 7 be yellow:
<pre>
&lt;color index="7" red="1" green="1" blue="0"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<h4><a name="shape">Shapes</a></h4>

Shapes can be specified with the element &lt;shape&gt;.
A shape specification includes which collection, which color table,
and which sequence or frame; a shape may also be allowed to be blank.
A shape's attributes are
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (0 to 31)
<li>clut: which color table; default is 0 (0 to 7)
<li>seq: which sequence (0 to 255)
<li>frame: like the above, included if the meaning of "frame" is clearer
in some context.
</ul>
A blank shape is specified as one having no attributes: &lt;shape/&gt;.
A non-blank shape requires the collection and sequence attributes,
and optionally the color-table attribute (default: 0).
<p>

<h4><a name="damage">Damage</a></h4>

Damage is specified with the element &lt;damage&gt;.
Damage features are set with these attributes, which are all optional.
<ul>
<li>type ("true" damage index; none is -1)
<li>flags (0 or 1 [is alien: weaker in easier difficulty levels])
<li>base
<li>random
<li>scale (1 = identity scaling)
</ul>
<p>

<h4><a name="font">Fonts</a></h4>

Fonts are specified with the element &lt;font&gt;
like colors, fonts may be either indexed (being list members), or non-indexed (being in isolation).
<ul>
<li>index (mandatory if indexed; must be absent if not indexed)
<li>name: the font name; it can be a series of names separated by commas or semicolons,
much like HTML font specifications.
If a series of the names, the engine will look for a font with the first name,
and then the second, and so forth, until it finds such a font.
<li>size: the font size in points (standard unit)
<li>style: the font style, which follows MacOS conventions; it is the sum of whichever of these
attributes are used:
<ul>
<li>1: Bold
<li>2: Italic
<li>4: Underline
<li>8: Outline
<li>16: Shadow
<li>32: Condense
<li>64: Extend
</ul>
Normal is none of these attributes, or 0.
<li>file: this is for SDL support, and indicate which font file to use.
</ul>
None of the font attributes proper are mandatory.
This example sets font 4 to the default font for the computer terminals.
<pre>
&lt;font index="4" name="Courier" size="12" style="0"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>


<h4><a name="boolean">Boolean data</a></h4>

This is not a separate element, but a kind of value of an attribute.
These values for a boolean attribute,
<ul>
<li>1
<li>t
<li>true
</ul>
indicate that a flag is to be on or an action is to be taken.
These values,
<ul>
<li>0
<li>f
<li>false
</ul>
indicate that a flag is to be off or an action is not to be taken.
